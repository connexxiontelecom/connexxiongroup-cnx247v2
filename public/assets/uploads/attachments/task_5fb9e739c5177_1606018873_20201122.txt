I saw a damsel
could she be an Angel
the thoughts crosses my heart
even in the dark of night

My heart stayed to wonder
and then paced to ponder
am I dreaming of this beauty
or I'm deep in reality

I couldn't but hear
oh my oh dear,
The music in her voice
again I saw the elegance in her poise


The gentle breeze whispered
as the moon glistered
the radiance on her skin
is none like I have seen

As I lay down to sleep
i fetched my treasures deep
the best that i would cherish
and these things for her I wish

that the brooks washed her feet
and the stars brighten her street
that she live in opulence
and ever walk with elegance

that amongst flowers her name be rose
that tales of her be the best prose
that if she would ever smile
let it be bright as the sky

That her bosom be of melody
while she dances to the symphony
let her fantasies
take beyond the galaxies

that the fragrance of the best flowers
pour out to her like soft showers
that she ever stands tall
and before her the best treasures fall.

I Saw a damsel
